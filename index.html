    <h1>Siqi Wang</h1>
    <p>
        Siqi Wang received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China in 2012, 
        the M.S. degree from the University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France, in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree from the University 
        of Paris-Est Marne La Vallée, Champs-sur-Marne, France, in 2018.,He was a Researcher Fellow with the Group of 
        Electrical Engineering-Paris (GeePs), Centralesupélec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, from 2018 to 2019. He has been 
        a Researcher Fellow with the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, since 2019. He has been an 
        Associate Professor with Sorbonne University, Paris, France, since 2021. He has authored or coauthored more than 
        30 journal articles and conference papers. His research interests include neuromorphic circuit modeling, energy-
        efficient optimization, digital predistortion, and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).

    <p>
        Electronics Division
        <br>The division has comprehensive expertise in the fields of modeling, design and characterization of electronic components, devices and systems.
        The skills thus cover the development of:
        <ul>
            <li>new transducer structures and innovative components with increased performance,</li>
            <li>analog electronics (physical/analog interface, analog processing in low frequency (LF) or radio frequency (RF)),</li>
            <li>mixed electronics (high-resolution or high-speed analog-to-digital conversion),</li>
            <li>digital electronics (algorithm/architecture matching with a multi-target approach involving FPGA, CPU, GPU and ASIC).</li>
        </ul>
        This expertise and skills are mobilized within a unique team relying on experimental characterization and test platforms, a CAD and TCAD platform.
