       Linearizing the PA in a base station of 5G and beyond telecommunication network has an important requirement on energy-saving and resource optimization. The challenge to be addressed is how to obtain a well-defined DPD block using low computational resources and to avoid large amount of data processing in the case where a real massive antenna array is deployed in experimental measurements. The emerging technique of the spiking neural networks (SNN) has shown a great potential in reducing power consumption and in variety of biomimicry for AI. Low power SNN can be embedded on user equipment (UE) for DPD model coefficients estimation tasks, which finally provide only the necessary parameters instead of the full segment of received samples to the base station for the DPD model training. In this project, we have worked on SNN to compute the DPD coefficients, which establishes an efficient wireless AI network to enable linearizing the PA and phased antenna array with high energy efficiency. The heterogenous information collected by UE is pre-processed in embedded small-scale SNN.

    The test bench for the system is illustrated in Fig. 2. The SNN algorithm has low complexity to be implemented on UE side. The 5G signal predistorted by the DPD will be load from the PC to the arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) to generate the RF signal. It is then upconverted by local oscillation generated by the vector network analyzer (VNA) to 27 GHz for the 128-antenna array. The antenna array can transmit and receive signals using Time Division Duplex (TDD). The vector spectral analyzer (VSA) and the digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) convert the feedback RF signal into baseband digital signals for further SNN computing.
